\title{Create App
Functions framework entry point that configures and starts web server
that runs user's code on HTTP request.
The following environment variables can be set to configure the framework:
  - PORT - defines the port on which this server listens to all HTTP
    requests.
  - FUNCTION_TARGET - defines the name of the function within user's
    node module to execute. If such a function is not defined,
    then falls back to 'function' name.
  - FUNCTION_SIGNATURE_TYPE - defines the type of the client function
    signature, 'http' for function signature with HTTP request and HTTP
    response arguments, or 'event' for function signature with arguments
    unmarshalled from an incoming request.
The server accepts following HTTP requests:
  - POST '/*' for executing functions (only for servers handling functions
    with non-HTTP trigger).
  - ANY (all methods) '/*' for executing functions (only for servers handling
    functions with HTTP trigger).}
